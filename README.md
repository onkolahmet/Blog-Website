# Blog Website
This project was a journal blog website template combined with database connection and flexibility of usage of ejs across the files.

The whole point of this project was to be more familiar with database usage more specifically [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).

It contains [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com) contents which is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content.
